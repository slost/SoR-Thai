How to create your own translations:

- Open any of the files in this directory.
- Place translated text in the 'Translation' column.
- Any rows that are not translated will revert to English.
- Be careful not to delete text in the 'STRING_ID' and 'English' columns, as this can break the game.
- For certain types of characters such as Chinese, Korean and Japanese, text may appear extremely small in
  certain spots in the game.  To fix this, go into the file "SOR Names - InterfaceNameDB.csv", find the row
  that says 'SpecialCharacterSizeFitting' and write True under the Translation column.
- To use a font that has Polish characters, go into the file "SOR Names - InterfaceNameDB.csv", find the row
  that says 'PolishCharacters' and write True under the Translation column.
- When saving the files, make sure to save the file in their original format.  Programs like Excel
  have a tendency to automatically save in specialized formats.  If you modify the file in Notepad,
  it should look the same as the original version.
- To view the translations in-game, go to the Languages menu under Settings, and set 'Fan Translations' to 'On'.

Please note that the there will be additions and changes to the rows with each new build of Streets
of Rogue released.

Feel free to share translations online, place them in Google Docs, and collaborate with each other.
Google Docs' Revision History feature will make it easier to see where I've made changes to text
between builds of the game.
